             <b>JEANS</b>
         </h3>

         <p>
         Although many of you have previously purchased skinny jeans, they are a terrible purchase.  Skinny jeans are type of trend that will most likely never come back in the future.  They have a terrible cut and are awfully uncomfortable and overall just terrible.  A better purchase would be tapered jeans and pants.  These are a timeless cut and will never go out of style.  They will also always fit you perfectly.  And if you want to stay up to date with trends you can also go with baggy jeans which are currently one of the most popular types of pants.<br><br>
         Another old fashion trend that seems to be impractical and will probably never come back will be distressed jeans.  This used to be an extremely popular look and everyone was trying to get distressed jeans.  But lets be honest these were never the best look.  Your clothes are supposed to not be ripped our distressed they are supposed to look nice.  This look is cheap and doesn't look exactly the best.  Instead go with minamal designs and try diffrent washes on your jeans but I would suggest going with minimal and simple jeans with no design.  These pieces will be timeless and can be used with any outfit.

             <b>ACCESSORIES</b>
         </h3>
         <p>
         Accessories are what truly elevate your outfits to the next level.  They add an extra element and are true difference makers.  They catch the attention of onlookers through the simple glimmers.  But how far should one go with accessories?  I would reccomend having a bracelet or watch on at all times and a chain is good as well.  On top of that 1-3 rings is a good range of rings to construct a beautiful outfit.  And sunglasses are also very good as they protect your eyes from the sun while also adding styleOverall accessories are the things that seperate you from the other guy sso get ahead on it and buys some rings and chains and try something new.  Here is a list of jewelry items I would reccomend you to buy:

             <b>Layering</b>
         </h3>
         <p>
         Layering is what makes fall and winter fashion the best of all time.  It adds extra dexterity and details to your outfit. It makes it look like you care.  A simple pant and shirt can be heavily elevated by adding just a simple overcoat.  Layering completes an outfit.  Each layer adds different vibes and makes the outfit complex and much more pleasing to look at.
